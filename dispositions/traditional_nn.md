## Traditional neural networks

### Linear decision boundaries

It can be hard to solve non-linear with linear models as if the data is not linearly separable, the model will not be able to separate the data.

Draw a linear separable problem and one with a non-linear decision boundary.

Solutions:

 - Linear transformations: Cartisian to polar coordinates for the circle example
 - Neural networks *
