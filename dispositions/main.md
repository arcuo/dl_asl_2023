You should prepare an 8 minute presentation on each of the following topics:

- [Machine learning fundamentals (lecture 2)](fundamentals.md)
- [Traditional neural networks (Lecture 3)](traditional_nn.md)
- [Convolutional neural networks (Lecture 4)](conv_nn.md)
- [Training ConvNets (lecture 5+7)](training_conv.md)
- [ConvNet architectures (Lecture 8)](conv_architectures.md)
- [Object detection and segmentation (Lecture 9)](obj_detect_segmentation.md)
- [Generative models (Lecture 10)](generative.md)
- [Visualizing and understanding ConvNets (lecture 11)](visualisation.md)

## Notes from slides

- Do not try to cover everything in 8 minutes; it is much better to pick one sub-topic and go into some
depth with that
- Use the whiteboard
- Powerpoints slides are not allowed
- Handwritten notes are okay, especially for
- Equations/formulas
- Mathematical derivations
